# Movies and TV shows info

A JavaScript/jQuery app designed using Bootstrap CSS and HTMl, that fetches movie / tv show data from the OMDb API. The requests to the API are made using Axios NPM, which is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.

[<strong>UPDATE June 03, 2017</strong>]The app doesn't work as the OMDB API initially used for requesting the data is not free anymore. They have gone private. So any requests made from my app returns an unauthorized request error (401). The following text mentions the update on the OMDB website.

We are going private!

05/10/17 - New API Keys! Due to some security concerns on how the keys were being distributed I updated the form to email them and also changed the algorithm used, which means your older keys not obtained through email will eventually stop working. 

05/08/17 - Going Private! Please go read the post on the Patreon page about this major change.
